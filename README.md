# template-repo-for-workshops

This repo is meant to be a template for making workshop/demo repositories that anyone should immediately be able to replicate with binder/colab

## Badges

### [Binder](https://mybinder.org/)

Binder can spin up an environment with dependencies from [environment.yml](.binder/environment.yml) already present, and viewers can interact with this environment immediately with effectively no setup on their end.

You can create a badge like this to launch a binder environment for this repo
